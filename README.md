# YouTube Spammer Purge

Allows you to purge all comments left by a user on a specific video or across the entire channel.

**How to Download:** Click the "[Releases](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YouTube-Spammer-Purge/releases)" link on the right, then on the latest release, under 'Assets' click to download "YouTubeSpammerPurge.exe". NOTE: You may get a warning - See "[Download & Windows Warning](#download--windows-warning)" section below for details.

* [MacOS Setup Instructions](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YouTube-Spammer-Purge/wiki/MacOS-Instructions)
* (Windows installation not necessary if using exe file. But read below for how to set up required API key)

## Purpose
Recently, there has been a massive infestation of spam on YouTube where fake impersonator accounts leave spam/scam replies to hundreds of users on a creator's videos. For some god-forsaken reason, YouTube offers no way to delete all comments by a specific user at once, meaning you must delete them one by one BY HAND.

YouTube offers a functionality to ban a user, but it does NOT delete previous comments. Therefore I created this script to allow you to instantly purge their spam replies.

## Usage Notes - IMPORTANT!

1. To use this script, you will need to obtain your own API credentials file by making a project via the Google Developers Console (aka 'Google Cloud Platform'). The credential file should be re-named `client_secret.json` and be placed in the same directory as this script. [See Instructions below](#instructions---obtaining-youtube-api-key).

2. **IF IT FREEZES** while scanning, it is probably because you clicked within the command prompt window and entered "selection mode" which pauses everything. **To unfreeze it, simply right click within the window, or press the Escape key.**

3. At the moment, this program doesn't ban the user, so do that yourself before deleting their comments. I'll add that function in the next version.

3. I'm a total amateur, so if something doesn't work I'll try to fix it but might not even know how, so don't expect too much. Therefore **I OFFER NO WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE FOR THIS SCRIPT. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.** I tested it on my own and implemented some failsafes as best as I could, but there could always be some kind of unexpected bug. You should inspect the code yourself.

## Installation

If using the python script version (not the exe), there is a requirements.txt with necessary modules. Created with Python 3.9.7

Either way, you DO need to acquire your own API credentials file to access the YouTube API - [See instructions below](instructions---obtaining-youtube-api-key).

**Operating System Specific Instructions:**

## Download & Windows Warning

Because I haven't published software before, web browsers and Windows might block the exe from downloading / running as "unrecognized" until it builds a reputation as being safe. In the meantime, you can simply unblock the program by Right Clicking > Properties > Check 'Unblock' > Click Apply. You can confirm the download by selecting "keep". (If you see these warnings at all)

## Instructions - Obtaining YouTube API Key

To use this script, you will need an "Oauth2" credential to access the scanning and deletion functions via YouTube's Data API. Otherwise this script won't work at all.
