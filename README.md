## Purpose

Recently, there has been a massive infestation of spam on YouTube where fake impersonator accounts leave spam/scam replies to hundreds of users on a creator's videos. For some god-forsaken reason, YouTube offers no way to delete all comments by a specific user at once, meaning you must delete them one by one BY HAND.

YouTube offers a functionality to ban a user, but it does NOT delete previous comments. Therefore I created this script to allow you to instantly purge their spam replies, and since then it has evolved into a fully featured spam scanner as well. **IT DOES NOT PREVENT SPAMMERS - It only makes it easier to delete them when they show up!** YouTube still must implement better native tools for dealing with spammers.

## ðŸ¤” Pro-Tip If This Seems Sketchy: Limiting The App's Access ðŸ¤”

If you feel sketched out about giving the app the required high level permissions to your channel (very understandable), you could instead use the app in 'moderator mode' (set in the config file). First, some context: When you grant access to another channel to be a moderator for your channel, they are able to mark comments for 'held for review', and this permission works through the API as well. 

_Therefore,_ what you could do is create an _blank dummy-google-account_ with nothing on it except a empty new channel. Then you can grant _that_ channel permission to be a moderator, and use the app through _the dummy moderator account_. **This way, you know that the app will never have the ability to do more than mark comments as held for review** (which the app supports) on your main channel, and have no other access to your account's data. You just won't be able to ban the spammers through this app directly, but you can still remove/hide their comments instead of deleting them. Just make sure to create the google cloud API project on the dummy account instead.

Read some additional details about 'moderator mode' on the [wiki page here](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YT-Spammer-Purge/wiki/Moderator-Mode-&-Limiting-Permissions).

## Usage Notes -READ THIS

1. To use this script, you will need to obtain your own API credentials file by making a project via the Google Developers Console (aka 'Google Cloud Platform'). The credential file should be re-named `client_secret.json` and be placed in the same directory as this script. [See Instructions Here](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YT-Spammer-Purge/wiki/Instructions:-Obtaining-an-API-Key).

2. **IF IT FREEZES** while scanning, it is probably because you clicked within the command prompt window and entered "selection mode" which pauses everything. **To unfreeze it, simply right click within the window, or press the Escape key.**

3. I'm a total amateur, so if something doesn't work I'll try to fix it but might not even know how, so don't expect too much. Therefore **I OFFER NO WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE FOR THIS SCRIPT. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.** I tested it on my own and implemented some failsafes as best as I could, but there could always be some kind of unexpected bug. You should inspect the code yourself.

## Installation

If using the python script version (not the exe), there is a requirements.txt with necessary modules. Created with Python 3.9.7

Either way, you DO need to acquire your own API credentials file to access the YouTube API - [See Instructions Here](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YT-Spammer-Purge/wiki/Instructions:-Obtaining-an-API-Key).

**Operating System Specific Instructions:**

* [Linux Setup Instructions](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YouTube-Spammer-Purge/wiki/Linux-Installation-Instructions)
* [MacOS Setup Instructions](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YouTube-Spammer-Purge/wiki/MacOS-Instructions)

## Instructions - Obtaining YouTube API Key
To use this script, you will need an "Oauth2" credential to access the scanning and deletion functions via YouTube's Data API. Otherwise this script won't work at all. 
* #### Instructions can be found on this page: [Instructions: Obtaining an API Key](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YT-Spammer-Purge/wiki/Instructions:-Obtaining-an-API-Key)
