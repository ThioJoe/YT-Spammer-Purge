  # To fix an error when running Poetry on Windows
  # (https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2629),
  # we set Poetry's cache directory to .poetry_cache in the current directory.
  # It makes it easier to later remove the virtualenv when it's broken.
  # Absolute path is necessary to avoid this issue:
