# ---------- Config file for YT Spammer Purge program ----------
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# • Lines with a hashtag are just comments / instructions
# • If you set a setting in here, the program will not Ask you to enter/confirm when your run it
# • If you leave the value as 'Ask', the program will Ask you for it as usual
# • Some settings might not be necessary depending on which modes you select
#
# • For 100% automatic usage of program, enter all values (or at least all for your scanning/filtering modes)
# • NOTE: Human confirmation is required for most settings to actually remove comments
#	- If comment removal is automated, comments are marked as "held for review" and hidden
#
# MORE NOTES:
# • Current filter modes that support automated comment removal:
#		- Scanning for exact channel ID(s)
#		- Auto Smart-Mode
# • If scanning someone else's channel, you can report spammers, but while in Auto-Smart Mode only
# 
# USING MULTIPLE CONFIG FILES:
# • You can create additional config files through the same menu used to create the initial config file
# 		- Then you can choose which config to use when starting the program
# • You can also make another config by just copying one and renaming it, adding a number such as: "SpamPurgeConfig2.ini"
